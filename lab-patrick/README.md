## Overview
A cowsay webpage that used webpack to dynamically updates what the cow(Ghostbusters symbol) says based on that you type into the form field.

## How to use
In your terminal, while in this directory, run
```
npm run build
```
Then open the index.js file in a browser window. You should see a ghostbubsters symbol and a form field at the bottom that you can enter anything you want the symbole to say.
Hit the log it button to log whatever you type in.
