# Mike Treat Angular.js Lab 21

## Intro into Angular

  In this lab we are learning how to use the Angular.js framework and how to use webpack. We will be building cowsay-browser application that will allow us to automatically update the view as the model is updated. When a user enters something into the input field it will update the cow's (or another other creature's) speech bubble to reflect what the user had entered. It will also update the speech bubble immediately as the user enters information into the text field, so the user can see what it will look like before they hit submit.
