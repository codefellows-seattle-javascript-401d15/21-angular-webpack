======

## What is this thing?
* This is a lab is meant as practice for building my skills with AngularJS. This particular lab utilizes the cowsay-browser npm module
* The purpose of this app is to allow a user to enter text into the text-field and watch it update the cow's speech bubble in real time
* An additional feature is that the user may use the drop down menu to select the cow face (ASCII art) which is used to display the message
* By clicking on 'Log it!', the user can view the message they typed into the text-field, via the browser console.
